# RPGEngine

RPGEngine is a project whose goal is to provide an interface for RPG games. 

## Installing and prerequisites

The project uses C++17. In order to set up a development environment, you must have a C++17 compiler.

No library is required, just clone the project\
`
git clone https://github.com/Sacrefeu/RPGEngine.git
`
\

Then the environment is now set up. You can now build, modify, use and distribute the engine (see "Built with" and "License" sections).

## Built with

A makefile using g++ compiler is supplied for this project. 

Feel free to add other build systems to this project (they have to compile to both shared and static C++ libraries though). If you want to modify makefile to accept other compilers, please make sure that it will compile with g++ by default.
